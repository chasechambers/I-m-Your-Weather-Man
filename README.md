# I-m-Your-Weather-Man

## Description

This app provides the current and 5 day forecast for a city of your chosing:

- I was able to work with fetching API data and using local storage and user input to select the weather.
- This really pushed my limits of javascript, allowing me different ways to create items such as event handlers.

## Installation

Site can be accessed at:

https://chasechambers.github.io/I-m-Your-Weather-Man/

## Usage

On the open of the page, you can classify, city, city and state, city state and country, or just city and country. After you search for something, it saves to your history. You can then click on history items to revist the weather.
